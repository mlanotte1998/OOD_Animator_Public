# OOD_Animator_Public

This repository has all of the information to use the end result of the "Easy Animator" from my Object Oriented Design class.

Due to the the instructors not wanting the code from the project to be public so they can continue using this project in the class, the code itself is not in this public repository. Instead, the jar file for the working project is here along with sample text files and the below instructions so that the animator can be used.
